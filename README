Caveats:
- The domain vaporwaresystems.com is taking some time to propagate DNS A record changes so i manually pointed the hostname and IP in 
  my /etc/hosts
- Google managed SSL is taking time to provision and saying to wait for 24 hours.
- For the above reason using http and static DNS resolution
