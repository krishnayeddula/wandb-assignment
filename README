 Caveats & Workarounds:
 DNS Propagation Delay: The vaporwaresystems.com domain is taking time to propagate A record changes. As a workaround, I manually mapped the hostname and IP in /etc/hosts.
 Google-Managed SSL Delay: SSL certificate provisioning is still in progress, with an expected wait time of up to 24 hours.
 Temporary Access: Due to the SSL delay, the service is currently accessible over HTTP with a static DNS resolution.
