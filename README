Successfully deployed the WANDB service on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using the terraform-google-wandb module (version 9.4.1).
Used Replit(Cloud based IDE) for this task

Deployment Details:
The deployment completed successfully, yielding the following outputs:
Endpoint URL: https://wandb-gcp.vaporwaresystems.com
Endpoint IP: 35.244.129.48

Terraform Details:
WANDB Module Version: 9.4.1
State Storage: Google Cloud Storage (GCS) is used as the backend for storing the Terraform state.

Artifacts:
The wandb-artifacts folder contains:
Screenshots of critical deployed resources, including:
 GKE Cluster
 Redis Memory Store
 SQL Server
 Cloud Storage Bucket
 Pub/Sub topic
 Screenshots of the WANDB homepage and system console
 A Python script used to provision 10 runs

 

 Caveats & Workarounds:
 DNS Propagation Delay: The vaporwaresystems.com domain is taking time to propagate A record changes. As a workaround, I manually mapped the hostname and IP in /etc/hosts.
 Google-Managed SSL Delay: SSL certificate provisioning is still in progress, with an expected wait time of up to 24 hours.
 Temporary Access: Due to the SSL delay, the service is currently accessible over HTTP with a static DNS resolution.

 Issues:
Although the WANDB console deployment is up and running with one healthy replica(which is equal to no.of replicas for the deployment), there is an additional pod in a CrashLoopBackOff state. I attempted to forcefully delete this pod, but the deployment automatically creates a new pod, which also enters the CrashLoopBackOff state. However, the overall functionality is not impacted, as the single healthy pod is maintaining normal operation.
